        <p>Hi Dali! I consider myself to be a very creative person. I love making ewelery and glass art at Dartmouth's Jewelry Studio, where I have been a teaching
        assistant for two and a half years now. </p>
        <p>I also love dance. In the last six months I have become involved with Street Soul's freestyle group. I am learning
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing">Break Dance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping">Popping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle_dance">
            Shuffle</a>, but Shuffling is my perferred style right now. You might see me preform around campus,
            and eventually at inter-college jams!</p>
