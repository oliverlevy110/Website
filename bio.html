        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Hi Dali! I am a Darmouth '20 majoring in Computer Science. I may declare minors in Math and French but I have not yet decided.'</p>
        <h3>Why Dali?</h3>
        <p>I am interested in Dali because I love learning about new businesses: their ideas, structures, markets, and capabilities.
          Dali helps makes these business grow and working with you would give me an opportunity like no other to see a range of ideas.
        </p>
        <h3>My Coding Interests</h3>
        <p> I enjoy web design, and would like to learn React and Vue sometime soon. I work and learn best when I have a concrete project to work on,
          so I believe working at Dali would give me the ability to grow my technical skills enormously.</p>
        <p> Since I run a linux distribution, I becoming more interested in programs that interface with the kernel and window managing systems.
           My favorite text editor is Neo Vim (of course).</p>
